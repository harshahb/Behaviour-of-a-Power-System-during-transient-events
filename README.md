# Behaviour-of-a-Power-System-during-transient-events
This project investigates power system dynamics during transient events, emphasizing fault analysis to enhance system stability and reliability.


This project delves into the realm of power system dynamics, investigating how a power system responds to transient events, including faults, switching operations, and abrupt load or generation changes. These transient events lead to rapid fluctuations in voltage, current, and frequency, potentially impacting the power system's stability and reliability.

The primary objective of power system dynamics is to ensure the power system's stability during these transient events. Stability, in this context, signifies the system's capacity to maintain a consistent operational state despite disturbances. Achieving this stability involves employing various control mechanisms, such as generator output adjustments, protective devices, and coordinated component operation.

In our project, we focus on the analysis of faults, which are significant transient events. We consider different types of symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults, including LLL, LG, LL, LLG, and calculate subtransient currents. This information aids in the selection of appropriate circuit breakers and enhances our understanding of transient stability.

Moreover, we determine the critical time for a 3-phase symmetrical fault, further contributing to the comprehensive analysis of power system dynamics and transient events.
